Questions:
1. Should serialNo of each message be unique, or should request-response pairs have the same serialNo?


Todo : 
1. Remove any unnecessary logging in the MulticastEndpoint class
2. move runnable tasks into runnable package
3. The receiver tasks currently are single-threaded. That is they add incoming messages to a data structure,
   and process messages in the data structure intermittently. Explore whether it would be better to designate 
   a threadpool in each receiver task for multi-processing the processing of messages? So we don't have to 
   necessarily create a new thread to handle each new incoming message, but rather have a fixed pool which may 
   be an improvement on the single-thread architecture.
4. make sure file paths work with the packaging arrangement
